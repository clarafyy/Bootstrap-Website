<h1>Operations</h1>
<p>
      Every Friday and Saturday night during the school year, SafeRides operates 8 cars. We take calls at (540)568-7433 from 10pm to 3am. Our volunteer workers can sign up for one of the following roles when they work a night of operations. </p>

      <h2>Driver </h2>
          <p> Drivers operate one of our 8 vehicles, some of which are JMU owned and some of which are rentals. They work in pairs with an assigned navigator. </p>
      
     <h2>Navigator </h2>
          <p> Our navigators, also called "navis" are paired up with a driver to work in the passenger seat for a night of operations. The role of a navi is to keep in contact with our office staff and the patrons we pick up. They keep track of each patron or set of patrons that their car picks up. They will text our logistics director with updates and text patrons when they arrive to pick them up. Navigators also ensure that all passengers follow our SafeRides protocol.</p>
      
     <h2>Phones Operator</h2>
          <p>In our SafeRides office (located in SSC), we have landline phones that are our point of contact for requesting rides. Our phones operators take calls as they come in and put each patron's information into our system. Because our service is anonymous, only first names are taken. We also ask for phone number so that our navigators can contact patrons when they are on the way, number of patrons so we can provide a car with an adequete number of seatbelts, and pickup and dropoff locations.</p>
      
      
    <h2>Logistics Director</h2>
      <p>Also working in the office is our nightly logistics director, also called "log." The log is in charge of all communication between the office and our cars. They take each patron's information (as recorded by the phones operators) and send it to each car in the order that the calls are received.</p>
